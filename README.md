# 👨‍💼 Employee Project Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes and processes **fragmented employee, project, and seniority data** to generate insights for **performance evaluation**. The script cleans, integrates, and manipulates raw datasets to produce a **final, consolidated DataFrame** with calculated bonuses and adjusted designation levels.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Organizations often maintain employee, project, and seniority data in separate, inconsistent formats. Without integration and proper cleaning, it’s difficult to evaluate employee performance effectively. This project is aimed to solve this problem

## 🛠️ Approach 

### **Situation**
Fragmented datasets for employees, projects, and seniority levels needed to be analyzed for performance review.

### **Task**
Create a **Python script** to clean, integrate, and manipulate the datasets for performance evaluation.

### **Action**
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and standardized data formats using **Pandas**.
- **Data Integration**: Merged employee, project, and seniority datasets into a single DataFrame.
- **Logic Application**: Applied **conditional rules** to calculate bonuses and adjust employee designation levels.
- **Libraries Used**: `pandas`, `numpy`

### **Result**
Produced a **clean, integrated dataset** enabling quick and accurate performance evaluation for all employees.
